- **Product Management**: Add, update, delete, and categorize products.
- **Order Management**: Place orders, track order status, view order history.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add/remove items, view cart summary, update quantities.
- **Payment Integration**: Secure payment processing with integrated gateways.(not yet)
- **Search and Filters**: Search for products by name,category, and price range.
- **Admin Panel**: A separate interface for admins to manage products, users, and orders.(not yet)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```
    git clone https://https://github.com/Dancan254/EcommerceApp.git
    cd EcommerceApp
    ```

2. **Configure the database**:
   Update the `application.properties` file with your database configuration:
    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ecommerce_db
    spring.datasource.username=root
    spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
    ```

3. **Build the project**:
    ```
    mvn clean install
    ```

4. **Run the application**:
    ```
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

5. **Access the API**:
   The application will start running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Key Functionalities

### 1. **User Management**
   - **Registration**: Users can register using a sign-up endpoint. Passwords are encrypted using **BCrypt**.
   - **Authentication**: Login is managed using JWT (JSON Web Token) for stateless authentication.
   - **Role-Based Access Control**: Two roles are provided: `USER` and `ADMIN`. Admins have additional privileges for managing products and orders.

### 2. **Product Management**
   - **Admin CRUD Operations**: Admin users can add, update, or delete products via secured endpoints.
   - **Product Categories**: Products can be categorized for easy filtering.
   - **Search and Filters**: Products can be searched by name, category, and price range.

### 3. **Order Management**
   - **Placing Orders**: Users can place orders by adding products to their cart and proceeding to checkout.
   - **Order Tracking**: Users can view the status of their orders and track their shipment.
   - **Order History**: View past orders and re-order items.

### 4. **Shopping Cart**
   - **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to their cart.
   - **Update Cart**: Users can update item quantities or remove products.
   - **View Cart**: A detailed summary of the cart including product names, prices, and total amount.

### 5. **Payment Integration**(not done)
   - **Payment Gateway**: Payments are securely processed through Stripe or PayPal integration.
   - **Order Confirmation**: Upon successful payment, an order confirmation email is sent to the user.
   
### 6. **Security**
   - **JWT Authentication**: Secure stateless authentication for users.
   - **Password Encryption**: User passwords are hashed and stored securely.
   - **Role-Based Access**: Restricted access to certain features for admins and users.
